# Resume_Categorization using Machine Learning
# Why do we need Resume Categorization?
For each recruitment, companies take out online ads, referrals and go through them manually. Companies often submit thousands of resumes for every posting. When companies collect resumes through online advertisements, they categorize those resumes according to their requirements. After collecting resumes, companies close advertisements and online applying portals. Then they send the collected resumes to the Hiring Team(s). It becomes very difficult for the hiring teams to read the resume and select the resume according to the requirement, there is no problem if there are one or two resumes but it is very difficult to go through 1000â€™s resumes and select the best one. To solve this problem, in this project we will read and screen the resume and categorize them using machine learning so that we can complete days of work in few minutes.
